# Decimal data type

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_data_type>

Made to represent decimals precisely, specially for financial operations.

Subset of fraction data types.

As of 2015, mostly implemented at the software level. [IEEE 754:2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point) however has defined an efficient binary representation that could be used by hardware implementations. The previous version IEEE 754:1985 did not define them.
