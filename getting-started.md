this is an overview of what to do to get started programming

to get started well, you need to do the following things
more or less at the same time

# learn a language

choose a lanaguage and learn it. I suggest in order:

- c
- c++
- python
- java

it is very subjective and difficult to analyse which is best

you *must* learn the standard library for the language you choose,
and important extra libraries

# applications

without them, you will be bored.

learn:

- calculus
- linear algebra
- probability

and their applications.

then:

- implement their applications yourself
- find an existing implementation and learn to use it

# learn basic command line language 

- bash on linux
- cmd on windows

# svc

learn (in order):

- git
- svn

#markup languages

- latex
- html
- markdown
- reStructuredText

# algorithm anaysis

- alorithm analysis (time/space)

    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms>

requires calculs, so learn calculus first before this

# data structures

- linked lists
- hash map

# low level computer workings

need this for performance!

- memory organization (stack vs heap)
- assembler
