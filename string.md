# String algorithms

Algorithms that operate on sequences of bytes.

## Suffix tree

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree>

String pre processing that allows for efficient solution of other string problems, e.g.:

- string search
- find longest repeated substring
- find longest common substring
- find longest palindrome substring

Concept introduced in 1973, but efficient algorithms for it's generation are non-trivial. First linear time algorithm (thus optimal) created by Farach (1997).

### Banana example

Take the input string `banana`.
