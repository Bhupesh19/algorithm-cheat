# gpl

- you can use, study, share (copy), and modify the software

- you *cannot* use it in non gpl projects (copyleft),
	meaning that you cannot make a closed source project that uses it.

# mit liscence

- like gpl

- except you *can* use in commercial projects,
	so you can basically do anyting you want,
	except remove the license from subproducts

# dual

some licenses are called dual X/Y (ex: dual BSD/GPL), meaning that you can
take either one of them.
