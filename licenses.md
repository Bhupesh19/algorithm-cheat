# Licenses

## MIT

- you can use, study, share (copy), and modify the software

- every substantial reproduction of the software must maintain the copyright note

Basically like GPL except you *can* use in commercial projects,
so you can basically do anything you want, except remove the license from sub products

## GPL

Like MIT< but you *cannot* use it in non GPL PROJECTS (COPYLEFT),
meaning that you cannot make a closed source project that uses it.

This makes the project useless for closed source projects to build upon.

## Dual

Some licenses are called dual X/Y (ex: dual BSD/GPL), meaning that you can
take either one of them.
