# DFA

Discrete finite automata.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization>

Recognize the same languages as regular expressions.

## Minimization

It is possible algorithmically minimize a DFA to an equivalent one with the smallest possible number of states.

The minimum is unique up to renaming, so it is also a good canonical form.
