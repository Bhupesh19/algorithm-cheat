# data-gen

Executables in this directory generate test data to output files.

Those scripts generate large inputs / output, random or not, that would be infeasible to write manually.

They are often used for performance benchmarking.

TODO:

- allow the `test` script to use the generated data and do the benchmark
- discard the cost of disk read from benchmarks
