# programming and ideas

    ideas (that can be programmed)
    +
    programming
    ------------------------------
    *power*

- without ideas, programming is useless!
- without programming, some ideas are useless!

# what computers do

- manipulate information

    - moving information around
    - reaching new information from old

    - fast
    - cheap
    - without errors

- information can be transformed into voltage
voltage in movement,temperature and light!

# manipulate information for humans

- learn
- have fun

programs can help:

- view
- edit
- transmit

stuff like:

- text
- books
- images
- music
- videos
- games

# change the future

1. predict the future

    - the *system*:
    
        - a robot arm
        - an airplane
        - the atmosphere

    - the way you think it changes

        this is called the *model* for the system

        - physics

            - mechanics
            - thermic
            - fluids
            - eletromagnetism
            - chemistry (== complicated physics)
            - biology (== complicated biology)
            - quantum

        - non-physics (extremelly complicated physics)
        
            - economy

    *but*:

    - some equations *cannot* be solved exactly

        typically: differentia equations (from calculus)

        must approximate

        approximation takes a very long time

        learn calculus as soon as possible

2. choose the best action possible

    this is called *optimization*

    may take a very long time

    - use the computer

3. act

    - move motors. use *actuators*. they *act*

    - move information. money in stock markets is information
