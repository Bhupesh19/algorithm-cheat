## Other bibliographies

- <https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books>: huge list of free books and algorithmic problem sets

## Free

- <https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos> similar to this with more algorithms, but where are the tests?

- <http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/>, which has lots GPL Java source. This kind soul has put the source up on GitHub: <https://github.com/aistrate/AlgorithmsSedgewick>

- <http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~algorith/>. Links to tons of open source algorithm implementations that solve many problems. Each algorithm has a rating, and algorithms are all classified.

## Algorithmic problem sets

My favorites are:

- [TopCoder](http://www.topcoder.com/active-challenges/develop). No solutions. 6M registered users. Money prizes. Some company proposed problems have Non Disclosure Agreements. Timed submission contests.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/categories/fp/intro). No solutions, 3M Round A. Timed submission contests.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). Data science focused. No solutions. Some problems have money prizes.
- [Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)](http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/all/). No solutions. 200K users, 10000 problems.
- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems). 350K users, only ~450 problems. No solutions. Since 2001. Probably one of the oldest around, but did not evolve much.
- [UVa](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=1). 100K registered users. No solutions. Slow website.
- [CareerCup](http://www.careercup.com): Interview questions.

Yearly contests:

- [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest](http://icpc.baylor.edu/). [Wiki](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest). No solutions. Eligibility: less than five years of university education before the contest. Started in 1977. [World final problems](http://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/problems).
- [Google Code Jam](http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html). Only a few solutions.
- [ICFP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICFP_Programming_Contest). One problem per year. Since 1998.
