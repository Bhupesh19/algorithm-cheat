# Push down automaton

Automaton for CFGs.

By default, PDA means implies non-deterministic,
as that matches context free grammars, which is a very popular topic.

## DPDA

Deterministic PDAs (DPDA), are strictly less powerful. A DPDA with one state recognizes LL(1).

Senizergues (1997), Godel Prize 2002, proved that equivalence of DPDA is decidable.
